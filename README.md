# MSUWebscraper

The goal of this project is to learn how to webscrape, and become better at creating custom projects within python. 
The first couple stages will include learning about the general concepts and abilities within webscraping packages such as httpx and selectolax.
Once an understanding is formed, the project will include pulling data from the Michigan State University dining hall website, and creating a website which assists in nutritional choices.
